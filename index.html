      <h2>About myself
        <p>My name is Matsvei and I am a novice frontend developer. I was born in Minsk, graduated from Minsk City Polytechnic College, specialty "electronics of mechanical vehicles", but realized that this profession is not suitable for me, and therefore began to learn programming languages HTML and CSS. This CV is written in these languages, as a test of acquired knowledge.</p>
