## *About Myself*

I want to become a front-end developer, but I'm just starting my journey in this direction. By education, I am very far from Frontend, as I completed my studies in the specialty "Automobile Electronics". I am a very energetic and kind person, if I can help in something, I will definitely help.
At the moment I have no IT experience, but as soon as there is such an opportunity to try out my new skills, I will definitely do it.:grin:
